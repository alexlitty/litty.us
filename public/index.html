        Out of JavaScript, huh?
        <br /><br />
        I don't blame you. You can hardly do anything without spending your hard-earned JavaScript these days. Everyone wants your JavaScript, but there's just not enough JavaScript for everyone.
        <br /><br />
        Do you remember when JavaScript was a prolific part of the great outdoors? Sturdy hands could take a scoopful right out of the mountains and sustain their familial JavaScript needs for months. We certainly didn't need anything like &lt;noscript&gt; back then. We didn't know what to do with all the JavaScript!
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        Gosh. Anyway...
        <br /><br />
        If you find some JavaScript and want to see some colored circles moving around on my personal website, you're always welcome back here. That's all there is to see here really. Genuinely, though -- These are some high-quality luxurious circles I'm offering. They're super-sampled, they move, and they have a neat effect when you hover your cursor over them.
        <br /><br />
        Alternatively, you can <a href="mailto:alexander@litty.us">email me</a> and I'll see if I can send you a picture of the circles, if I have enough JavaScript myself to do so. It won't be the same experience, but it might satiate your curiosity in these trying times. You can also email me about other things, like career opportunities and Undertale fan theory discussions.
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        I hope you find some JavaScript soon, or find some other means of executing arbitrary code on your machine!<br /><br />Good luck and strive for your happiness,
        <br /><br />
